I've been working on a [ScrabbleHacker](https://paulnegedu.com/projects/scrabble) and it is finally working! ScrabbleHacker is easy to use; simply enter at least 2 letters, click the SUBMIT button and the results will be displayed üòÅ.

This is a single-page application created with ReactJS. I chose React because it efficiently updates and displays the
right components when a new word is found.
Using recursion, it creates every permutation of the word and pushes it to an array. For example, if you submit
‚Äúdogs‚Äù the permutations are [d, do, dog, dg, dgo, o, od, odg...]

To determine which permutations are English words, it uses a nodeJS package which provides an array of all English words. In order to be time-efficient, the ScrabbleHacker changes this array of English words to a dictionary object because object have a time-complexity of
bigO(1)but arrays are bigO(n).

If a permutation exists in the dictionary, then it is considered a solution. ScrabbleHacker calls Owlbot‚Äôs API to determine the figure of speech and provide the definition for each found word. Finally, the results saved as react components and displayed.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
